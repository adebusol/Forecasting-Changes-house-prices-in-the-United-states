# Forecasting-Changes-house-prices-in-the-United-states
Despite the desire for urban living, the market for all resources is growing more competitive. Rent, food, water, and electricity are unaffordable for a middle-class household. 
Living costs have increased significantly due to inflation making a comeback and the 8% price increase in the US housing market. 
The cost of apartments in the city is increasing and estimating the price of a home is terrifying. 
The housing market is a crucial indicator of how well a country's economy is performing, and house price forecasting is a crucial aspect of real estate. 
We are motivated to predict changes in US property prices. To find models that apply to home buyers and sellers, machine learning techniques are utilized to evaluate historical 
real estate transaction data from the Federal Reserve and house price data from Zillow. To predict future home prices, we will assist in reasonably forecasting house values. 
This data will be merged and combined, and a random forest model will be trained using it. 
The model will forecast whether future home prices will rise or fall. Backtesting will be used to quantify the error before adding additional predictors to strengthen our model.
